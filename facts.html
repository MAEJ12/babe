            <h2>Common Facts</h2>
            <div class="fact-container">
                <h3>Fact: Drug addiction is a disease, not a choice.</h3>
                <p>Many people mistakenly believe that drug addiction is simply a matter of poor decision-making or a lack of willpower. However, research has shown that addiction is a chronic disease that fundamentally alters brain function.</p>
            
                <h4>How Addiction Affects the Brain</h4>
                <p>When a person repeatedly uses addictive substances, the brain's reward system is hijacked. Drugs trigger a surge of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and motivation. Over time, the brain adapts to these surges by reducing its natural dopamine production, making it increasingly difficult for a person to feel pleasure from everyday activities. This leads to dependence, where the person continues using drugs just to feel "normal."</p>
                
                <h4>Why Quitting is Difficult</h4>
                <p>Once addiction develops, quitting is not as simple as deciding to stop. The brain undergoes physical and chemical changes that make withdrawal symptoms severe. People suffering from addiction often experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intense cravings</li>
                    <li>Anxiety, depression, and mood swings</li>
                    <li>Physical pain, nausea, and tremors</li>
                    <li>Impaired decision-making abilities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These challenges make it nearly impossible for an addicted person to stop using drugs without medical treatment, therapy, and support systems.</p>
                
                <h4>The Importance of Treatment and Support</h4>
                <p>Because addiction is a disease, treating it requires professional help, much like diabetes or heart disease. Recovery is possible through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) to manage withdrawal symptoms</li>
                    <li>Counseling and behavioral therapy to address underlying psychological triggers</li>
                    <li>Support groups and rehabilitation programs for long-term recovery</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="fact-container">
                <h3>Fact: Prescription drugs can be just as dangerous as illegal drugs.</h3>
                <p>Many people assume that prescription medications are always safe because they are prescribed by doctors. However, misusing these medications—taking them in ways other than prescribed—can be just as harmful as using illegal drugs.</p>
            
                <h4>How Prescription Drugs Become Dangerous</h4>
                <p>Prescription drugs are powerful substances meant to treat specific medical conditions. When taken correctly under a doctor’s supervision, they can be beneficial. However, misuse occurs when:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A person takes more than the prescribed dose</li>
                    <li>A person takes the medication without a prescription</li>
                    <li>A person uses the drug to get high instead of treating a medical condition</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Many prescription medications—especially opioids, sedatives, and stimulants—can cause addiction, overdose, and even death if misused.</p>
            
                <h4>Types of Prescription Drugs Commonly Misused</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Opioids (Painkillers)</strong>
                        <p>Examples: Oxycodone (OxyContin), Hydrocodone (Vicodin), Morphine, Fentanyl</p>
                        <p>Dangers: Highly addictive, can cause respiratory depression (slowed breathing), overdose, and death.</p>
                        <p>Risk Factor: Many heroin users started with prescription opioids before moving to illegal drugs.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sedatives & Tranquilizers (Anti-Anxiety & Sleep Medications)</strong>
                        <p>Examples: Xanax, Valium, Ativan</p>
                        <p>Dangers: Can cause memory loss, drowsiness, confusion, and overdose (especially when mixed with alcohol).</p>
                        <p>Risk Factor: Long-term use leads to dependence, and withdrawal can be dangerous.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stimulants (Used for ADHD & Narcolepsy)</strong>
                        <p>Examples: Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta</p>
                        <p>Dangers: Can increase heart rate and blood pressure, cause paranoia, and lead to heart attacks or strokes.</p>
                        <p>Risk Factor: Students often misuse these drugs to enhance focus, leading to addiction.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            
                <h4>Why Are Prescription Drugs So Addictive?</h4>
                <p>Like illegal drugs, prescription medications alter brain chemistry. Opioids, for example, bind to receptors in the brain that control pain and emotions, producing euphoria (a "high"). Over time, the brain builds tolerance, meaning a person needs higher doses to feel the same effect. This leads to dependence and addiction, making it extremely hard to stop without help.</p>
            
                <h4>The Risk of Overdose & Death</h4>
                <p>Misusing prescription drugs can be fatal, especially when mixed with other substances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Opioids + Alcohol = Respiratory failure (stopped breathing)</li>
                    <li>Sedatives + Alcohol = Extreme drowsiness, coma, or death</li>
                    <li>Stimulants + High Doses = Heart attack or stroke</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The U.S. and other countries have seen a major opioid crisis, with thousands of people dying from prescription drug overdoses every year.</p>
            
                <h4>How to Prevent Prescription Drug Abuse</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only take medication as prescribed by a doctor.</li>
                    <li>Never share prescription drugs with anyone, even if they have similar symptoms.</li>
                    <li>Store medications safely to prevent misuse by children, teens, or others.</li>
                    <li>Dispose of unused medications properly (many pharmacies offer drug take-back programs).</li>
                    <li>Seek help if struggling with dependency—addiction is treatable with the right support.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Common Myths</h2>
            <div class="myth-container">
                <h3>Myth: If a doctor prescribes it, it must be safe.</h3>
                <p><div class="myth-container">
                    <h3>Myth: If a doctor prescribes it, it must be safe.</h3>
                    <p>Many people assume that prescription medications are completely safe simply because they are prescribed by a doctor. While these medications are meant to treat medical conditions, they can be harmful, addictive, and even deadly if misused.</p>
                
                    <h4>Why Can Prescription Drugs Be Dangerous?</h4>
                    <p>Even though a doctor prescribes a medication, it doesn’t mean it is safe for everyone or for all situations. The safety of a drug depends on:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ The right dosage</li>
                        <li>✅ The patient’s medical history</li>
                        <li>✅ How it is taken</li>
                        <li>✅ Whether it is used only as directed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Misusing a prescribed drug—even one extra pill or taking it for the wrong reason—can have serious consequences.</p>
                
                    <h4>Common Ways Prescription Medications Are Misused</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🚨 <strong>Taking More Than Prescribed:</strong> Some people think taking an extra dose will relieve pain or anxiety faster. However, higher doses can cause dangerous side effects, overdose, or addiction.</li>
                        <li>🚨 <strong>Using It Without a Prescription:</strong> Just because a doctor prescribed a drug for one person does not mean it is safe for someone else. Medications affect people differently based on weight, health conditions, and other factors.</li>
                        <li>🚨 <strong>Taking It for Non-Medical Reasons:</strong> Many prescription medications alter brain chemistry, and taking them for non-medical reasons can be habit-forming.</li>
                        <li>🚨 <strong>Mixing It with Other Substances:</strong> Prescription drugs can be extremely dangerous when mixed with alcohol or other medications, leading to slowed breathing, coma, or even death.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>Prescription Medications That Can Be Addictive or Harmful</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Opioids (Painkillers)</strong> – Example: Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Morphine
                            <p>Risk: Highly addictive; can slow breathing and cause overdose.</p>
                            <p>Danger: Many heroin users started with prescription opioids.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Benzodiazepines (Anti-Anxiety & Sleep Medications)</strong> – Example: Xanax, Valium, Ativan
                            <p>Risk: Can cause drowsiness, confusion, memory loss, and overdose.</p>
                            <p>Danger: Withdrawal from long-term use can be life-threatening.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Stimulants (ADHD & Narcolepsy Medications)</strong> – Example: Adderall, Ritalin, Concerta
                            <p>Risk: Increases heart rate, blood pressure, and can cause paranoia.</p>
                            <p>Danger: Commonly misused by students for studying, leading to dependency.</p>

                    </ol>
                
                    <h4>Why Do Prescription Medications Become Addictive?</h4>
                    <p>Prescription drugs change the brain’s chemistry in ways similar to illegal drugs. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opioids flood the brain with dopamine, creating a strong sense of pleasure and pain relief.</li>
                        <li>Over time, the brain develops a tolerance, meaning higher doses are needed to feel the same effects.</li>
                        <li>This leads to dependence (needing the drug to feel normal) and, eventually, addiction.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>The Truth: Prescription Drugs Are Not Always Safe</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🔹 Just because a doctor prescribes it does not mean it is safe to take in higher doses or for the wrong reasons.</li>
                        <li>🔹 Prescription drugs should only be taken by the person they are prescribed for.</li>
                        <li>🔹 Misuse can lead to addiction, overdose, and even death.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h4>How to Use Prescription Medications Safely</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ Follow the doctor’s instructions exactly.</li>
                        <li>✅ Never take someone else’s prescription.</li>
                        <li>✅ Store medications securely and out of reach of children.</li>
                        <li>✅ Dispose of unused medications properly.</li>
                        <li>✅ Seek help if you or someone you know is struggling with prescription drug misuse.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="myth-container">
                        <h3>Myth: You can’t get addicted if you only use drugs occasionally.</h3>
                        <p>Many people believe that occasional or recreational drug use is harmless and that addiction only happens to those who use drugs every day. This is false. Even occasional drug use can lead to dependence, addiction, and serious health risks, especially when dealing with highly addictive substances like opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, and nicotine.</p>
                    
                        <h4>How Occasional Drug Use Can Lead to Addiction</h4>
                        <p>Even if you only use drugs occasionally, you are still exposing your brain to chemical changes that can lead to addiction. Here’s how:</p>
                    
                        <h5>1. Drugs Hijack the Brain’s Reward System</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✅ When you take drugs, they flood your brain with dopamine, a chemical that creates feelings of pleasure and reward.</li>
                            <li>✅ Your brain starts associating drug use with pleasure, making you want to do it again.</li>
                            <li>✅ Over time, the brain starts needing more of the drug to feel the same effect—this is called tolerance.</li>
                            <li>✅ Eventually, the brain may stop producing dopamine naturally, making you feel depressed or anxious without the drug.</li>
                            <li>✅ This cycle can quickly lead to dependency and addiction, even if you started with “just once in a while.”</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h5>2. Some Drugs Are Highly Addictive Even After One Use</h5>
                        <p>Not all drugs have the same addiction risk, but some are so powerful that a single use can start the process of dependence.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>🔹 Opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, Fentanyl) – These painkillers can cause intense euphoria and quickly rewire the brain’s pleasure system. Many people develop a dependence after just a few uses.</li>
                            <li>🔹 Methamphetamine (Meth, Crystal Meth) – A powerful stimulant that creates an extreme dopamine rush, making people crave more. Some people report addiction after just one or two uses.</li>
                            <li>🔹 Cocaine & Crack Cocaine – Can cause intense highs followed by crashes, leading people to take more to maintain the effect. This cycle can start the addiction process quickly.</li>
                            <li>🔹 Nicotine (Cigarettes, Vapes) – Even social smoking or vaping can cause cravings, leading to daily use. Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>The Slippery Slope: Occasional Use Can Turn Into Regular Use</h4>
                        <p>Even if someone only uses drugs once a month or at parties, the brain still remembers the pleasure associated with the drug. This can lead to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>❗ Increased Cravings – Over time, you may start thinking about the drug more often.</li>
                            <li>❗ More Frequent Use – Occasional use turns into weekly or daily use.</li>
                            <li>❗ Loss of Control – What started as "just for fun" turns into needing the drug to feel normal.</li>
                            <li>❗ Full-Blown Addiction – Dependence grows, and quitting becomes extremely difficult without help.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>The Truth: Any Drug Use Puts You at Risk</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>🔹 No one plans to become addicted. Addiction happens gradually, often without realizing it.</li>
                            <li>🔹 Even occasional drug use can cause permanent changes to the brain, increasing the risk of addiction.</li>
                            <li>🔹 The earlier someone starts using drugs, the higher the risk of long-term addiction.</li>
                            <li>🔹 Some drugs are so powerful that one or two uses can start the cycle of dependence.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>How to Stay Safe</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>✅ Avoid trying addictive substances, even “just once.”</li>
                            <li>✅ Educate yourself about the risks of drug use.</li>
                            <li>✅ Seek healthy ways to cope with stress and emotions without substances.</li>
                            <li>✅ Surround yourself with people who encourage a drug-free lifestyle.</li>
                            <li>✅ If you or someone you know is struggling with drug use, seek professional help early.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                        <p>The idea that “occasional drug use is safe” is a dangerous myth. Every use carries a risk—for some people, it takes just one time to start a downward spiral. The safest choice is to stay drug-free and choose a life full of opportunities, health, and happiness.</p>
